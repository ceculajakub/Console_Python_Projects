# Console_Python_Projects
My Python console projects mainly  focused on using different structures. I also posted some algorithms implementations

Projects:

- 2d_list_split_fill - My main goal was to get to know multidimensional lists and work with them. I focused on solving this filling problem as clearly as I could
and do it in optimal way.

- chessboard_problem - Practical algorithmic problem including two-dimensional list and numeric conditions. In addition I decided to solve it by using recursive function.
I also practiced some loops and "if" instructions. 

- finding_optimal_set_of_resistors - Project focused on implementation of recursive function with optional arguments. Working on regular list.

- linked_list - In this project I have started learining object oriented side of Python. I created my own structure which implements singly linked list and figured out how to work
with this structure.

- linked_list_task - This project is kind of next step of the "linked_list" project. I created function that relocates chosen Node, also I did a little of system conversion with 
some numeric conditions. 



These are my console Python projects. I hope I will have some time to update this repository, but now I'm mainly focused on learning C#.
